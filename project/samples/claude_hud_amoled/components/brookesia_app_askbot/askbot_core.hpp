// AskBot core: the same conversation flow as brookesia_app_chat, carried over
// Akka.NET remoting instead of BLE.
//
// The device registers a client actor at
// akka.tcp://<local system>@<ip>:<port>/user/chat and sends from it, so the host
// actor's Sender.Tell(...) lands right back here - stages, reply chunks, session
// changes - as ordinary actor messages. Protocol details:
// project/samples/akka/PROTOCOL.md.
//
// Unlike the BLE apps in this firmware, this one needs IP: Akka classic remoting
// is TCP. WiFi is therefore started lazily, the first time the app is opened, so a
// user who never touches AskBot never has the radio brought up.
